    abstract = {Language learnability has been investigated. This refers to the following situation: A class of possible languages is specified, together with a method of presenting information to the learner about an unknown language, which is to be chosen from the class. The question is now asked, “Is the information sufficient to determine which of the possible languages is the unknown language?” Many definitions of learnability are possible, but only the following is considered here: Time is quantized and has a finite starting time. At each time the learner receives a unit of information and is to make a guess as to the identity of the unknown language on the basis of the information received so far. This process continues forever. The class of languages will be considered learnable with respect to the specified method of information presentation if there is an algorithm that the learner can use to make his guesses, the algorithm having the following property: Given any language of the class, there is some finite time after which the guesses will all be the same and they will be correct. In this preliminary investigation, a language is taken to be a set of strings on some finite alphabet. The alphabet is the same for all languages of the class. Several variations of each of the following two basic methods of information presentation are investigated: A text for a language generates the strings of the language in any order such that every string of the language occurs at least once. An informant for a language tells whether a string is in the language, and chooses the strings in some order such that every string occurs at least once. It was found that the class of context-sensitive languages is learnable from an informant, but that not even the class of regular languages is learnable from a text.}

    abstract = {The problem of identifying an unknown regular set from examples of its members and nonmembers is addressed. It is assumed that the regular set is presented by a minimally adequate Teacher, which can answer membership queries about the set and can also test a conjecture and indicate whether it is equal to the unknown set and provide a counterexample if not. (A counterexample is a string in the symmetric difference of the correct set and the conjectured set.) A learning algorithm L∗ is described that correctly learns any regular set from any minimally adequate Teacher in time polynomial in the number of states of the minimum dfa for the set and the maximum length of any counterexample provided by the Teacher. It is shown that in a stochastic setting the ability of the Teacher to test conjectures may be replaced by a random sampling oracle, EX( ). A polynomial-time learning algorithm is shown for a particular problem of context-free language identification.}

    abstract="In this paper a new Grammatical Inference method is proposed. In this method, a finite-state automaton is constructed by means of an incremental procedure which performs both Inference and Recognition in an integrated and simultaneous way. The (incremental) growth of the inferred automaton is controlled by explicitly minimizing (by Dynamic Programming Methods) the number of states added when each new sample is presented. This procedure has been shown to achieve an ``abstraction'' process which tends to capture all the relevant variability present in the local (sub)structures of the patterns being considered, and their concatenation, as well as in the lengths (extents) of these structures. The results of the application of this method to a (simple) Automatic Speech Recognition task are presented, showing its capability of achieving recognition rates which are higher than those obtained with the automata constructed by hand by experienced speech researchers.",

In view of limiting the increasing complexity as the sample size grows, we propose a semi-incremental procedure. Finally, an experimental protocol to assess the performance of a regular inference technique is detailed and comparative results are given.",

The results show both the viability and appropriateness of the application of MGGI to the problem considered.}
